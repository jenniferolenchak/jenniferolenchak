# Jennifer Olenchak: Your Favorite Computer Scientist 😄

Graduating in May 2023, I am currently working on a B.S. in Computer Science, an undergraduate certificate in cyber operations, and a minor in mathematics. I attend the Burnett Honors College at the University of Central Florida. 

I currently work as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for UCF's College of Engineering and Computer Science. In this role, I lead review sessions and host office hours to facilitate student’s learning of COP3502: Computer Science 1 course material. I also develop original C code examples to reinforce fundamental computer science concepts such as problem solving techniques, algorithms, abstract data structures, order analysis, and recursion.
